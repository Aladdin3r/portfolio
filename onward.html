                <p>
                    During our research phase, we found:
                    <ul class="context-list">
                        <li class="context-items">
                            <strong class="highlight">44%</strong> of internationally-educated healthcare workers are overqualified 
                            for their current position
                        </li>
                        <li class="context-items">
                            & over <strong class="highlight">25%</strong> of immigrants experience severe interview anxiety
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                    With this in mind, we first crafted our primary persona, <strong class="subhighlight">Marco Dizon</strong>, a nurse from the Philippines who has been struggling to find work in Canada.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We aimed to create a solution to help Marco and others like him navigate the Canadian healthcare job market.

                <h2 class="section-title">Plan</h2>
                <p>Our primary goals and values for Onward included:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Encouraging nurse <strong class="subhighlight">growth</strong> by providing feedback</li>
                        <li>Allowing <strong class="subhighlight">confidence</strong> to flourish with tailored practice</li>
                        <li>Helping nurses tell their stories by growing their language and <strong class="subhighlight">communication</strong> skills</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Establishing these goals, we created a structured site map with user flows for the main features of the app. 
                    Due to time constraints, our primary focus was on the practice interview feature/flow, 
                    which accomplished our goals to help Marco grow.

                <p>
                    On a tight schedule, I jumped straight into development, before the designs were even completed for the first iteration! 
                    Because of this limitation, to ensure quality and consistency, we conducted usability tests with our target users during each feature sprint
                    to pinpoint any issues with our user flow. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    To ensure efficiency and meeting our Agile goals for each sprint, which was rolling out a complete feature each week, we used Chakra UI components
                    to quickly build out our app and maintain a consistent design system.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One of the main challenges we faced during development was simplifying the user interface in the 
                    "practice interview" feature, to ensure that users could easily navigate through the flow to receive feedback. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Combining my roles as lead developer and UX architect, I consulted with our target users and outside mentors 
                    to find a solution, which was to reduce the amount of buttons on the screen, and provide micro-interactive feedback to actions taken by the user.

                <h2 class="section-title">Results</h2>
                <p>
                    After 4 months of development, we successfully launched Onward, and had the opportunity to present it live
                    to an audience of over 200 people, including industry professionals, government officials, and potential investors.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Over the course of the project, we were able to:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Structure practice interview sessions catered towards the role our users are applying to</li>
                        <li>Provide tailored feedback with prompt engineering through the STAR method and use AI to highlight filler words</li>
                        <li>Allow users to review their interview sessions and continue practicing!</li>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Due to the time constraints, we were unable to implement all the features we had planned, like the ability to practice with the user's 
                    native language, but we are continuing to develop the app and hope to launch it in the near future.
