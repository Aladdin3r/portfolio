                <p>
                    SafeCycle was created in response to the increasing number of pedestrian and cyclist accidents in urban areas. 
                    The app was designed to help users find the safest route to their destination by allowing users to input warnings for high-traffic areas, construction zones, and safety hazards.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Since pedestrians include a wide-range of differently-abled people, SafeCycle had to have personalized navigation options for accessibility.
                </p>

                <h2 class="section-title">Plan</h2>
                <p>
                   To ensure that SafeCycle achieves its goal of providing safe routes for pedestrians and cyclists, the team decided to implement the following features:
                   <ul>
                          <li>Customizable route options</li>
                          <li>Real-time traffic/safety updates (by user input)</li>
                          <li>Knowledge of transportation safety through a quiz</li>
                   </ul> 
                </p>
            </section>
            <section id="action" class="case-section" data-media="image" data-src="public/safecycle-wireframes.webp" data-caption="SafeCycle's main features wireframed">
                <h2 class="section-title">Action</h2>
                <p>
                    We started off wireframing the main features of the app, jumping straight to hi-fi prototypes to test with users. 
                    Some initial issues pointed out through user testing were:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Difficulty navigating to the home page (Severe)</li>
                        <li>Difficulty in finding the accessibility options with saved routes (moderate)</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Having tackled these design issues, we moved on to developing the app using NextJS and Google Maps API.
                    This is where many issues occurred, as this was the first time implementing an API into a project, and the API itself had many limitations. 
                </p>

            <section id="results" class="case-section" data-media="image" data-src="public/safecycle-results.webp" data-caption="SafeCycle's final design">
                <h2 class="section-title">Results</h2>
                <p>
                    SafeCycle was able to provide a safe route for pedestrians and cyclists, but the app was not as user-friendly as we had hoped. 
                    The app was able to provide routes that avoided high-traffic areas and construction zones, but the app was not able to provide accessibility options for differently-abled users.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The app was also not able to provide real-time traffic updates, as the Google Maps API was not able to provide this feature.
